<h2>Steelhead Behavior: </h2>
<p>&emsp; Rainbow trout are opportunistic feeders that rely on a wide variety of food items ranging from small insects to crayfish. Trout inhabiting streams with a significant amount of riparian vegetation often feed heavily on terrestrial insects, such as grasshoppers and ants that fall into the stream. Rocky stream riffles produce bottom-dwelling aquatic invertebrates, such as insects and crustaceans that are also fed upon. In lakes and streams, invertebrates such as plankton, crustaceans, snails, and leeches, as well as small fish and fish eggs also serve as food for trout. </p>
<p>&emsp; Bank structure, in-stream wood and boulders, and riparian vegetation provide protective refuge and hiding cover for rainbow trout. Undercut banks, overhanging vegetation, turbulent or deep water, submerged or semi-submerged wood, aquatic plant beds, root masses, and large rocks also contribute to habitat diversity for rainbow trout and other aquatic life important to trout for food. Riparian vegetation (vegetation growing along a river or stream) such as trees, shrubs, grasses, and forbs provides shade which moderates water temperatures and is a source of woody cover when limbs and trees fall into the stream. Roots of riparian vegetation help stabilize stream banks, reducing siltation and maintaining water quality. Riparian plants also provide habitat for terrestrial insects that may serve as trout food. </p>

<p>&emsp; It’s depends on who you believe. Most often the answer is yes, but it’s not like humans as they don’t close their nonexistent eyelids. </p>
