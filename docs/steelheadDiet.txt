<h2>Steelhead Diet: </h2>
<h3>General Dietary Habits</h3>
<p>&emsp; Steelhead trout are opportunistic omnivores, meaning they will feed upon whatever is available in their environment. The steelhead trout's diet includes aquatic plant life, insects and animal life. The steelhead's diet tends to fluctuate drastically based upon climate, environment and availability; the maturity and size of the steelhead also impacts the feeding behaviors of the fish.</p>
<h3>Young Feeding Behaviors</h3>
<p>&emsp; The diet of young, immature steelhead trout is comprised almost entirely of zooplankton, tiny aquatic animals found in a variety of environments. It can take up to seven years for young steelhead to mature, and during this time, the fish will live and grow in a freshwater environment. The duration spent in ocean water affects physical development of steelhead trout: increased time in the ocean makes the fish turn silver (rather than the dull pink and silver found in the steelhead's freshwater counterpart, the rainbow trout). </p>
<h3>Adult Feeding Behaviors</h3>
<p>&emsp; Adult steelhead trout can weigh up to 40 lbs. and reach 12 inches in length. Small fish, mollusks (like aquatic snails) and insects comprise the foundation of the mature steelhead's diet. In freshwater habitats, steelheads will eat baitfish, like smelt. Insects often consumed are stoneflies, mayflies and the associated larvae. The eggs of other fish (known as "roe") will, if available, make up a part of the steelhead's diet. </p>
<h3>Spawning and Diet</h3>
<p>&emsp; During spawning (the steelhead's mating season) from mid-April through June, the steelhead ventures to the ocean to lay eggs. During the mating season, steelheads lose tremendous amounts of fat thus increasing their dietary needs when returning to their regular freshwater environment. A study at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service showed that the greatest food consumption occurred in August, after the fish returned from spring and summer spawning. </p>
<h3>Environment and Feeding</h3>
<p>&emsp; If food isn't readily available in the steelhead's environment, the fish will migrate upstream or to other areas of its environment to locate sustenance. While searching for food, the steelhead can cover a tremendous amount of water, making its way through large lakes and streams. According to research conducted at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, sample studies of steelhead's stomach contents show that, in general, the majority (by weight) of the fish's diet is comprised of invertebrates, zooplankton and fish. </p>
