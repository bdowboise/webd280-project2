    <h2>Steelhead Diet Information</h2>

    <div class="col-xs-12 well">
        <h3>General Dietary Habits</h3>

        <p class="lead">Steelhead trout are opportunistic omnivores, meaning they will feed upon whatever is available in their
            environment. The steelhead trout's diet includes aquatic plant life, insects and animal life. The
            steelhead's diet tends to fluctuate drastically based upon climate, environment and availability; the
            maturity and size of the steelhead also impacts the feeding behaviors of the fish.</p>

        <h3>Young Feeding Behaviors</h3>

        <p class="lead">The diet of young, immature steelhead trout is comprised almost entirely of zooplankton, tiny aquatic animals
            found in a variety of environments. It can take up to seven years for young steelhead to mature, and during
            this time, the fish will live and grow in a freshwater environment. The duration spent in ocean water
            affects physical development of steelhead trout: increased time in the ocean makes the fish turn silver
            (rather than the dull pink and silver found in the steelhead's freshwater counterpart, the rainbow
            trout). </p>

        <h3>Adult Feeding Behaviors</h3>

        <p class="lead">Adult steelhead trout can weigh up to 40 lbs. and reach 12 inches in length. Small fish, mollusks (like
            aquatic snails) and insects comprise the foundation of the mature steelhead's diet. In freshwater habitats,
            steelheads will eat baitfish, like smelt. Insects often consumed are stoneflies, mayflies and the associated
            larvae. The eggs of other fish (known as "roe") will, if available, make up a part of the steelhead's
            diet.</p>

        <h3>Spawning and Diet</h3>

        <p class="lead">During spawning (the steelhead's mating season) from mid-April through June, the steelhead ventures to the
            ocean to lay eggs. During the mating season, steelheads lose tremendous amounts of fat thus increasing their
            dietary needs when returning to their regular freshwater environment. A study at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
            Service showed that the greatest food consumption occurred in August, after the fish returned from spring
            and summer spawning. </p>

        <h3>Environment and Feeding</h3>

        <p class="lead">If food isn't readily available in the steelhead's environment, the fish will migrate upstream or to other
            areas of its environment to locate sustenance. While searching for food, the steelhead can cover a
            tremendous amount of water, making its way through large lakes and streams. According to research conducted
            at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, sample studies of steelhead's stomach contents show that, in
            general, the majority (by weight) of the fish's diet is comprised of invertebrates, zooplankton and
            fish. </p>
