    <h2>Steelhead Mating and Reproduction</h2>

        <p class="lead">As spawning time nears, steelhead adults enter tributaries of the main river they have
            ascended, or swim to the upper reaches of the mainstream. Those entering tributaries tend to swim farther up
            than chinook or coho salmon in order to find cool spawning areas with smaller-sized gravel. Once the fry emerge from the
            gravel, they survive and thrive in cool streams that have: “ 1) good streamside vegetative cover to keep the
            water cool and provide plenty of leaf litter for growing the insects that steelhead eat and 2) lots of wood
            and boulders in the stream to create riffle-pool complexes with plenty of places to hide and rest.”
            (Fitzpatrick 1999) In those tribs where the waters tend to recede and warm with the advance of summer,
            the young steelhead drop into the main river. As spawning time nears the female steelhead selects a section
            of appropriate graveled stream bottom where she excavates a <em>nest</em>, a depression, by turning on her
            side and swishing her tail vigorously. A typical nest is one to two feet across, and several inches to a foot
            deep. No more than a quarter of the hen’s eggs are deposited in the nest. As the eggs are expelled from
            the female, the buck releases sperm in a milky matrix which washes through the eggs, hopefully fertilizing
            all. Once her male suitor has fertilized the crop, Ms. Steelhead moves upstream of the eggs and excavates
            another nest. In a model of natural efficiency, as the hen creates the second nest she is covering the
            first. The Dance continues as more nests are created, the eggs are laid and fertilized, and the female
            steelhead is finally emptied of her precious cargo. The collection of these four, five, or six nests
            is referred to as a <em>redd</em>.</p>

        <p class="lead">There is a species survival advantage for not depositing all the eggs in a single nest. If any
            of the eggs go unfertilized, a fungus can invade that egg, then, eventually, spread to destroy the entire
            nest. Because they are physically isolated one from the other, the fungus from an infected nest will
            usually not be able to spread to the next.</p>

        <p class="lead">Having deposited her entire egg supply, the spent female, now known as a kelt, is finished.
            She will eventually resume feeding, rebuilding her strength, and make a move to the ocean again. Her life’s
            work for this year is complete once the last nest has been covered. She will now go her own way and the
            mating partner, his. Unlike the Pacific salmon which die soon after spawning, a spent steelhead can
            survive. With a lot of luck these fish will return to this stream next year to repeat this procreative
            drama.</p>

        <p class="lead">The male, like his counterpart of the human species, complicates matters for himself. He is
            capable of
            spawning with other females. Instead of being satisfied with one successful mating encounter, the male now
            seeks out another ripe female. Maybe he finds one; maybe he doesn’t. He may have to physically fend off
            more potential suitors with the same plan. In addition to the exhausting rigors of spawning, an embattled
            buck may be torn and wounded by other would-be boyfriends. Between the wounds and physical exhaustion,
            the buck may not be able to survive the return to the ocean. He may very well die in the stream of his
            birth. There’s a lesson here somewhere for us all, guys</p>

             class="img-responsive img-rounded pull-right"/>

        <p class="lead">The buried, fertilized eggs develop and undergo a metamorphosis over the next 2 – 3 months.
            Slowly, the egg starts to “morph” into a tiny fish. In several weeks the egg has a small fish head and a
            small fish tail with a relatively huge belly which is the shrinking egg. At this stage the developing
            steelhead is referred to as an alevin. Having provided the infant steelhead with nourishment up to this
            point, the egg will eventually be entirely absorbed. The completion time for the final absorption of the
            egg depends on water temperature, taking longer in colder water. Then, the luckiest, most determined
            little steelhead will wriggle, zig, and zag through the maze of interstitial spaces in the gravel to make
            it into the wide open expanse of the stream. Here, they must now seek out food items on their own to
            sustain themselves and grow. Most of a survivor’s siblings may not make it, buried forever, never emerging
            from where they were “hatched”. The tiny survivor, then, must search for food, while at the same time
            not becoming a meal for a larger predator. And, many more of his baby steelhead comrades who’ve made it
            this far will not survive their first few weeks in open water, having been eaten, starved, or swept to
            their deaths, unable to find shelter in raging winter river flows. For those that do make it through their
            first year in the river, many, again, will not see their second.</p>

             class="img-responsive img-rounded pull-left"/>

        <p class="lead">The cruel sifting of natural selection continues. It is usually in the spring at age two when
            most of our
            Pacific Northwest steelhead juveniles begin a journey downstream that will eventually lead them to the
            Pacific Ocean. That is, of course, if they survive future survival trials from dams, fishermen, more
            predators, disease, injury, and potentially lethal high water temperatures. Again, most of those that
            actually begin the trip toward saltwater won’t make it in typical years.</p>

        <p class="lead">Newly emerged tiny steelhead swim freely, exploring their spacious, dangerous environment. The
            fry’s parents
            are no longer around as they have already returned to the ocean and/or died after fertilization. If their
            luck at surviving continues, the fry which beat the odds will stay in their home stream here in the Pacific
            Northwest for one or two years, attaining lengths of four to eight inches. In the spring, responding to
            their biological urge, on the move, the young steelhead start migrating downstream, headed for saltwater.
            For some in the lower portions of coastal streams, the journey is short, maybe a few miles. Those in the
            heart of Idaho may have to traverse many streams and rivers, journeying almost a thousand miles to reach the
            Pacific, where most will stay to dine for one or two years. Some rare individuals, most often from British
            Columbia, will remain in the marine environment for three or four years.</p>

        <p class="lead">Initially, the tiny fry school in quiet protected portions of the stream, usually along its
            periphery. Here
            they are sheltered from strong currents and predators as they forage for food items. Their diet consists
            mostly of small aquatic insects, and the occasional terrestrial. In the first weeks as free-swimming
            roamers, the mortality rate can be very high, and largely determines the size of the surviving class of a
            given river for that year.</p>

        <p class="lead">As the steelhead grow larger over the next few months, the tendency to school with its sibling
            disappears.
            Most juveniles strike out on their own for a more solitary existence. With growth, physical features and
            markings on their bodies become more evident. At this point they are commonly referred to as parr,
            characterized by large, oval-shaped markings on the fishes’ sides. For the next one to three years ---
            usually two --- the parr steelhead focuses on food and survival. Driven by their inherited instincts, in the
            spring of their second full year most steelheadsmolt, beginning their downstream journey to the ocean. The
            smolts, usually 4” - 8” long, just keep following and following the flowing river maze until it reaches
            saltwater. </p>

        <p class="lead">Upon entering the ocean, the journey in the salt is far from over. Our little Pacific Northwest
            adventurers
            make their way hundreds, if not a thousand miles or more, out into the Pacific Ocean to spend a year or,
            more typically, two, in the very general vicinity of Alaska’s Aleutian Islands. Some British Columbia and
            Alaskan fish may spend three or four years. Those migrants of extreme southern Oregon, south of Cape Blanco,
            and those fish from California Rivers, stay much nearer the coast in the Pacific. All have answered some
            instinctual and environmental cues which take them to their marine stations. Here they feed, they grow and
            they frolic until their genes prompt them to return to their home stream as sexually mature adults.</p>
